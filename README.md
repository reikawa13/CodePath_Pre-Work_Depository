## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Google Map:
- Looking up restaurants nearby
- Calculating the fastest or cheapest route to the destination

LINE:
- Connecting my account with my frieds' ones living abroad
- Sending not only texts but also stickers

Spotify:
- Collaborating with other people to create a playlist together
- Downloading songs and making them accessible offline

Photos:
- Keep time and location of the photos
- Can make share albums with my family and friends

App idea:
Building an app that connects campus map with different events happening on university campus on the day. 
The app will have a map of campus on which info about events pop up around where they take place. 
If the user agrees to share their location, when they approach the area that some events are planned to 
take place, they get the notification about the events. Certified users can gain permissions to edit and 
add event information. 

## Notes

At first, I struggled with finding different featuers on the xcode, such as Adjust Editor's Options. 
Also, I failed multiple times when I was trying to push this product onto GitHub and re-tried again. 
Finally, it took several hours to create a GIF, upload it, and finish it up.
